It's been exactly 2 years since the first stable version of React Navigation was released. It quickly became one of the most popular navigation libraries. Today is another big milestone for us. We've been working on React Navigation 5 for around 6 months in order to address many limitations with previous versions and to improve the API to make it more dynamic.

Finally, we're proud to announce the stable version of React Navigation 5.

## Highlights

### Component based configuration

### New hooks

- useNavigation
- useRoute
- useNavigationState
- useFocusEffect
- useIsFocused
- useLinking
- useScrollToTop
- useHeaderHeight

### Update options from component

### New theming API

### First-class types with TypeScript

### Redux DevTools integration

### Native Stack Navigator

### Native backends for Material top tab navigator

### Other improvements

- Revamped drawer navigator to make customizing the drawer sidebar content easier and more flexible
- Simpler API for reset action
- Reliable `focus` and `blur` events
- Integration with `InteractionManager`
